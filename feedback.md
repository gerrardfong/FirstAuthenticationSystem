# Feedback

### **Strengths**
1. **Basic Structure**:
   - The code is modular, with functions (`start`, `newstart`, `login`, `register`, `change_password`) handling specific tasks.
   - It uses loops and conditionals effectively to handle user input and program flow.

2. **User Interaction**:
   - The program provides clear prompts and feedback to the user, making it user-friendly.

3. **Password Validation**:
   - The `register` function ensures that passwords are at least 4 characters long, which is a good start for basic validation.

### **Issues and Suggestions for Improvement**

#### 1. **Insecure Password Storage**
   - Passwords are stored in plaintext in the `passwords` list, which is a major security issue.
   - **Fix**: Use a library like `bcrypt` to hash passwords before storing them and verify the hash during login.

   Example:
   ```python
   import bcrypt

   salt = b"$2b$12$ieYNkQp8QumgedUo30nuPO"

   # Hashing a password
   hashed_password = bcrypt.hashpw(password.encode(), salt=salt)

   # Verifying a password
   if bcrypt.checkpw(input_password.encode(), hashed_password):
       print("Login successful!")
   ```

---

#### 2. **Inefficient User and Password Matching**
   - The `login` function uses nested loops and index matching to validate users and passwords, which is error-prone and inefficient.
   - **Fix**: Use a dictionary to store users and their hashed passwords for direct lookup.

   Example:
   ```python
   users = {"sithLord": hashed_password1, "d_Vader": hashed_password2}
   ```

---

#### 3. **Duplicate `change_password` Function**
   - There are two `change_password` functions defined, which is redundant and can cause confusion.
   - **Fix**: Remove the duplicate and consolidate the logic into a single function.

---

#### 4. **Password Change Logic is Incomplete**
   - The `change_password` function does not actually update the password for the user.
   - **Fix**: Update the password in the `users` dictionary (or list) after validating the user.

   Example:
   ```python
   def change_password():
       user = input("Please re-enter your username: ")
       if user in users:
           new_password = input("Enter your new password: ")
           users[user] = bcrypt.hashpw(new_password.encode(), bcrypt.gensalt())
           print("Password updated successfully!")
       else:
           print("User not found.")
   ```

---

#### 5. **Global Variables**
   - The `users` and `passwords` lists are global, which is not ideal for maintainability.
   - **Fix**: Pass these as arguments to functions or encapsulate them in a class.

---

#### 6. **Error Handling**
   - The program does not handle invalid inputs or errors gracefully in some cases (e.g., accessing invalid indices in lists).
   - **Fix**: Add proper error handling using `try-except` blocks and validate inputs more robustly.

---

#### 7. **Code Readability**
   - The code lacks comments and has inconsistent formatting, making it harder to understand.
   - **Fix**: Add comments explaining the purpose of each function and improve formatting.
